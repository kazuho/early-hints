                An HTTP Status Code for Indicating Hints
              draft-kazuho-early-hints-status-code-latest

Abstract

   This memo introduces an informational status code for HTTP that can
   be used for indicating hints to help a client start making
   preparations for processing the final response.

1.  Introduction

   Most if not all of the web pages processed by a web browser contain
   links to external resources that need to be fetched prior to
   rendering the documents.  Therefore, it is beneficial to send such
   links as early as possible in order to minimize the time spent until
   the browser becomes possible to render the document.  Link header of
   type "preload" ([Preload]) can be used to indicate such links within
   the response headers of an HTTP response.

   However, it is not always possible for an origin server to send a
   response immediately after receiving a request.  In fact, it is often
   the contrary.  There are many deployments in which an origin server
   needs to query a database before generating a response.  It is also
   not unusual for an origin server to delegate a request to an upstream
   HTTP server running at a distant location.

   The dilemma here is that even though it is preferable for an origin
   server to send some headers as soon as it receives a request, it
   cannot do so until the status code and the headers of the final HTTP
   response is determined.

   HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) push can be used as a solution to the issue, but
   has its own limitations.  The resources that can be pushed using
   HTTP/2 are limited to those belonging to the same origin.  Also, it
   is impossible to send only the links of the resources using HTTP/2
   push.  Sending HTTP responses for every resource is an inefficient
   way of using bandwidth, especially when a caching server exists as an
   intermediary.

   This memo defines a status code for sending an informational response
   ([RFC7231], section 6.2) that contains headers that are likely to be
   included in the final response.  A server can send the informational
   response containing some of the headers to help the client start

   making preparations for processing the final response, and then run
   time-consuming operations to generate the final response.  The
   informational response can also be used by an origin server to
   trigger HTTP/2 push at an caching intermediary.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  103 Early Hints

   This informational status code indicates the client that the server
   is likely to send a final response with the headers included in the
   informational response.

   A server MUST NOT include Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding, or any
   hop-by-hop headers ([RFC7230], section 6.1) in the informational
   response using the status code.

   A client MAY speculatively evaluate the headers included in the
   informational response while waiting for the final response.  For
   example, a client may recognize the link header of type preload and
   start fetching the resource.  However, the evaluation MUST NOT affect
   how the final response is processed; the client must behave as if it
   had not seen the informational response.

   An intermediary MAY drop the informational response.  It MAY send
   HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) push responses using the information found in the
   informational response.

3.  Interoperatibility Issues

   Clients may have issues handling Early Hints, since informational
   response is rarely used for requests not including an Expect header
   ([RFC7231], section 5.1.1).  Therefore, it is desirable to negotiate
   the capability to use the status code.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

   If Early Hints is standardized, the HTTP Status Codes Registry should
   be updated with the following entries:
